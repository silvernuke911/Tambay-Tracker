03/13/25,05:23:33 PM,Silvernuke,"I just finished the note system, good luck next soldier"
03/14/25,12:51:10 AM,Anon,"I am so tired of being unappreciated in this little shit. I work and work and work and all I get is a stern congratulations and a 'meh' while I place effort on the things I want to place effort in. This is bullshit, this is so fucking bull."
03/14/25,01:25:28 AM,Anon,Bruh bruh bruh what the sigma?
03/14/25,01:30:00 AM,Silvernuke,"This functionality is just about done. Good luck to whoever is gonna read this in some faraway time. I envy you, for you did not have to work through a couple weeks to make a functional operating system whos sole purpose is to record tambay hours. Such advancement is lost on me, but here we are. To whoever is my successor, good luck,  and take care."
03/14/25,09:27:13 AM,Silver,"About to start the JL demands, wish me luck"
03/14/25,09:28:36 AM,Silver,"Yknow, this very much can be a good diary or journal entry, which is insane. Eitherway, it's pretty cool"
03/14/25,09:30:32 AM,Anon,"I wonder if I can add ""double quotes"" in here"
03/14/25,09:32:32 AM,Anon,"KAS class is pretty boring, and this has become a whatchamacallit. So, quite indeed, quite indeed"
03/14/25,10:18:04 AM,Anon,Yooooo!
03/16/25,11:10:48 PM,Silvernuke,"So here we are again. What a day, huh?"
03/17/25,03:20:03 AM,Vercil,"I talked with two distinct girls tonight, on two different platforms. One was feisty and complained about her current arrangement with a guy, I had fun with her and her discussions of 40 minute blowjobs and tongue techniques, she was 18 too. Ripe for the picking. Talked to her for more than enough hours to know everything I could, she's from Lipa, Batangas and studies in DLSL. Wild girl, made me crave sex.\n   The second one was a girl in Cavite that studies in NU, 22 years old, her last partner broke up with her because he was avoidant. I wonder where I heard that before huh, HAHAHAHAH. But yeah. 3 months broken up, she said she's looking for new partners, and she was pragmatic and petite. She's an anstrology girl, told me about venus retrograde and the like, about the secure, anxious, and avoidant personality types. She studies computer science (wow, a girl in computer science, rare pull), interesting talks and exchange of ideas. It was... wonderful.\n I'm writing so I don't forget. So that I remember what this night for me was, where I talked to two different girls and their perspectives, and wallowed in their digital company. It was lovely."
03/17/25,03:21:51 AM,Silver,"Perhaps, one day, I will find love where I feel secure and no longer have to feel alone every time. To go home and to feel love from a woman you crave for, to wallow in their embrace, to shower in their kiss, to lay on their bossoms. That is the dream, is it not."
03/17/25,07:59:03 PM,Anon,"It's Shane's birthday today, he treated us with 24 chicken. Well, serves right, I guess. BUt hey, he's genuinely trying to be a good guy, I can feel that, he's just a fucking ass sometimes. "
03/18/25,11:04:04 AM,Anon,I'm really really really starting to hate theory. Statistical mechanics is just fucking bullshit. Sir Galapon's way of teaching is so fucking boring it's insane I haven't dropped out of it yet.
03/18/25,11:06:20 AM,Anon,I'm sleepy as fuck boi.
03/18/25,12:25:59 PM,Anon,"Just after Physics 191, pretty aight."
03/18/25,01:04:34 PM,Anon,"starting Physics programming lab again, is exciting"
03/18/25,06:26:00 PM,Jeiru,Mama mo
03/18/25,11:29:53 PM,Silver,"Not a lot of things can be said to me today. Nadia came over me while I was waiting for a jeep and showed a goat with bangs. Then immediately left. After two months of no contact, that's, well, wow, woman. Fucking insane. I think it's only a matter of time before she begins to crack. This is interesting, to say the least. Very interesting."
03/20/25,09:08:02 PM,Anon,"I know this may sound unkind, but I have been very unsatisfied with this life that I have lived. I could have been better, could have soared higher. I had more potential. I was promised the world. I... was a genius in the mind of a child, at least that was what they told me. And look at me now, unnaccomplished, broke, and have nothing to live for.I have failed myself. I have failed what I should be. Is it really my decisions, or is there no free will? If I can go back, can I do better. Are the roads really fit to be traversed at once? Certain decisions that I did. What if I never joined a fraternity. What if I kept to Nadia's words and not treat her like a princess that she is. The singular events that happen that seem out of our control but really is. The what ifs, the road not taken. The life of regret. "
03/20/25,09:08:21 PM,Anon,Live life with no regrets.
03/20/25,09:09:28 PM,Anon,"I miss her. The curve of her body, her supple breasts, her light touch. I miss... it all. I miss her so much."
03/20/25,09:09:47 PM,Anon,"I feel so lost, my love."
03/23/25,03:25:56 PM,Anon,My entire life spins with emptiness that I cannot describe. What has become of me? What will become of me. What have I become to be such an empty husk of a human being
03/23/25,03:27:20 PM,Silver,"Elizze talked to me the other day, about a letter that I wrote some time ago. Asked me what it meant. I overshared a bit. Maybe this or that. She's starting to break, maybe this will finally be the end of this fucking stalemate and she would talk to me. No longer is it that way. I have become dry and disillusioned with myself. What has become of my life."
03/23/25,03:28:18 PM,Silver,"The life that could have been lived, huh?"
03/27/25,03:00:18 PM,Anon,"Don't quite know what's gonna happen today. I'm a mess, I'm tired, I want to just end it. "
04/02/25,03:02:11 AM,Silver,"Back in friday, 03/28, Rae has been pretty provocative of me on drinkout night. Essentially she was very physical and kind to an insurmountable degree that it almost seems like she's into me, which has had me acting unwise and overthinking for the last few days. What's worse was there were audiences and witnesses that night, which made the situation that much worse. I think I was attracted to her, and she has relieved me of thinking of Nadia for a while there. Had my imagination running. I was very weary though, very very weary. But it was fun, ghiblified a few of our images, and generally goofed around. Observations iminent as to wether to confirm these suspicions. Then tonight, yesterday night at the time of writing, Nadia has messaged me with a long letter apologizing and explaining, which has had me even more confused. And now we are back to talking again, once again in conversation, which is stupid to a degree that is not appreciable. I am fucked, or rather, being fucked both ways by these two women, one unconfirmed, one very confirmed. And they're both from AstroSoc, so, dear god, I am cooked. I just received my nomination for presidency equivalent and this is how I am greeted by fate. Conflict of interest, on god. I never imagined I will be at the mercy of the astrosoc goth girl and the astrosoc sundress girl. Fucking insane.  I am cooked, significantly, and without fail. I am so so cooked that it isn't even funny anymore."
04/02/25,03:02:44 AM,Anon,"My lips, your lips, apocalypse."
04/02/25,03:14:45 AM,Pilak,"Y'know what's a good idea? Add a log for the actions done on this fucker, it should be fun. Basically the same format, date, time, word input, resulting action, shit like that. For every significant comand like saving this or saving that. I should develop that. So I guess let's add this to the development ideas, along with the automatic mobchart maker, with b24 testing. I'll just flag this as one gigantic [DEVELOPMENT IDEA][DEVELOPMENT IDEA][DEVELOPMENT IDEA][DEVELOPMENT IDEA]"
04/02/25,03:16:59 AM,Anon,"Some nights I stay up cashing in my bad luck, some nights I call it a draw. "
04/08/25,11:39:00 AM,Ag,"She came back on the evening of April 3rd, because I approached her and she asked me again if she can date me, and I told her on a condition. She said she'll commit now, and I said okay, and so, we went on a date again, on UPTC. We went on another date on the fourth, spending time until 2 AM, and we went to see each other again on the fifth, where we spent time together on a concert (UP Fair Rev) the entire night, with me holding her and us singing together. We spent time again on sunday, watching How to Lose A guy in 10 days, and yesterday too, no specific action, we were just together. It's been... so sweet, she's been so lovely, yet I fear another rugpull. She's done this shit before, so I can't be so complicit. I'm leaving myself too vulnerable again for her to hurt me, and I cannot help but fear. I fear another deceit, another lie. I hope I can trust her again, despite everything she has done. I hope this gamble works out, I hope she will keep her word. But if not, then this is really the last, because I don't want to anymore, I no longer desire to be with a girl who keeps on lying to me and lying to herself. I hope this works out. ISTG if this is another rug pull, I'll just let Rae pull up and do what she wants to do. I am not out of options, but Nadia is. But I don't want to, because I want only her. But I cannot trust her again until some time, so we find ourselves in a bit of a contradiction, and only time will tell what happens next."
05/29/25,05:01:20 PM,Anon,"Hi there, been  a while. Me and Nadia are going strong for about two months now. Approaching the monthsary. She's been lovely, and so far we've been healthy, and her responses to me are more grounded, at the very least. She sucked my dick, and we've made love quite a lot of times. Anyway, most of what I have done right now are just research and studies, with the occassional skirmish with that fuckass Shane. Fucking asshole. Anyway, sem's almost done, I just have to process my DOST and my incompletes, and after that, I'm a free man. I just need to pay off the house and find a good job during the midyear period, where she will be gone and going to Albay for her internship. But yes, notes, it has been quite lovely."
05/29/25,05:04:08 PM,Anon,"Oh, and by the way. We're official. She asked me to be her boyfriend on May 15th, I said yes. So quite indeed, quite indeed. Life is bearable."
05/29/25,05:06:52 PM,Anon,"Last entry is from April 7th. Boy, I have been slacking off. Anyway, I plan on finishing this fucker tonight, so let's get it on!"
05/29/25,05:37:51 PM,Pilak,"Added a new feature which allows me to access low level system commands in this fuckass program by entering ""sys"" unto itself. Works pretty good, yeah?"
05/29/25,05:40:21 PM,Anon,That fuckass song Anxiety will be the death of me
05/29/25,06:06:00 PM,!,"so i added the command log functionality, i'm done here. i'll log the other fucker attendances later. thanks!"
